# To Do

- [ ] Design metaprogramming features
- [ ] Make sure the abstraction covers all the use cases
- [ ] Compare to sm_td
- [ ] Add packages and imports
- [ ] Add enums
- [ ] Add units of measure
- [ ] Sugar for combos
- [ ] Sugar for holding down a key: `hold "a" for 5 * seconds to port`
- [ ] Sugar for emitting a string


## checks

- [ ] Every event handler's action is valid: press, release, key, tick.
- [ ] At most one state section per node.
- [ ] No duplicate function names (but duplicate handlers are allowed).
- [ ] All named nodes in edges exist and have a matching orientation.
